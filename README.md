This is an example of a READEM file. It is exactly what it sounds like - a file ONLY used to tell humans (not computers) about the repository and the files within them.

Your TODO:
- PUll this Repo
- Open this Repo/Folder in visual Studio Code
- Create your own branch
- Add something to this readme file
- Commit your change!

That's it! You can find a walkthrough for how to do this here:
